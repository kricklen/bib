            <remarks>A large input message buffer can help performance while fetching data from the database because it reduces the number of network messages.
            Note that a large input message buffer can affect system throughput because of concurrency.
            Any row currently in the input message buffer can have a shared lock on it (depending on the isolation level) preventing other users from changing that row.
            Therefore, a large input message buffer can cause more shared locks to remain than are necessary.</remarks>

            </summary>
            <value>Size of buffer, in bytes</value>
            <remarks>The most important messages sent from the client to the database server are SQL commands to compile or a row of data to insert.
            A large output message buffer does not necessarily increase performance because it only needs to be large enough to hold the largest SQL command to compile, or large enough to hold the largest row of data to insert.
            A large output message buffer can allocate space unnecessarily on the both the client and the server. Rows are always inserted and sent one row at a time (except in bulk execute mode).
            A larger output message buffer does not reduce network traffic unless bulk execute is on.</remarks>

            Customize the type returned from GetValue on a SQLBase FLOAT column.
            </summary>
            <remarks>The FLOAT format as stored in SQLBase has more precision than IEEE 784 floating point numbers.
            The default in .NET is to fetch as a decimal (System.Decimal) value.
            However that type does not support the min and max range of a FLOAT column.
            To retrieve the full range of values from SQLBase, set the FloatFormat to Float or Double to return the value as the appropriate .NET type.

            Customize the type returned from GetValue on a SQLBase LONG VARCHAR column.
            </summary>
            <remarks>The LONG VARCHAR type was originally the only LONG type, so some databases may have binary data stored there.
            The default in .NET is to fetch as a Char[].
            However that doesn't return a nice readable value
            This can be used in the connection string to customize how LONG data should be read.
            This only affects LONG VARCHAR. LONG VARBINARY always returns byte[], and LONG NVARCHAR always returns Char[].

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Reason: The application program was attempting to convert an SQLBase
            	error return code to another "resultant" error code and the
            	original SQLBase return code could not be found in the
            	translation file. This indicates that the translation
            	table was found but the error within the translation table was
            	not found.
            
            Remedy: Add the SQLBase error code to the error translation file or add
            	an asterisk as a global error catch-all. The translation table
            	consists of x,y entries, where x is the SQLBase code to be
            	converted to y. An entry of *,999, for example, will return a
            	translated error code of 999 instead of this message. See the
            	SQLBase configuration parameter ERRORFILE= for more information
            	on the translation file and its usage.

            Remedy: Determine which select buffer is too small and increase the size

            Reason: SQLBase has located incompatible version of ERROR.SQL.
            
            Remedy: Verify that the correct ERROR.SQL is in one of the following:
            	your current directory, the root directory, the \SQLBASE
            	subdirectory under the root directory, or in a directory

            Reason: The application program is attempting to perform a function

            	application program may be using an old or mismatching version

            	application has been terminated.
            
            Remedy: Correct the application program. Verify that the cursor is
            	valid.  To verify the cursor value, print the value of cursor
            	after the connect and then before and after the function call

            Reason: A network transmission problem has occurred while operating with

            	"Back end give up" is displayed on the server F2 screen and this
            	error is returned to the client workstation.
            
            Remedy: Try to reproduce the error. If error is reproducible,
            	try the same scenario on another client workstation. If the
            	problem is reproducible on the second (i.e., any) client

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Reason: Application program is attempting to enable fetch backwards
            	(sqlefb) when the compiled SQL SELECT statement contains an
            	ORDER BY clause and the column or columns to be ordered on are
            	not indexed.
            
            Remedy: Revise application to comply with fetch backward restrictions.

            <remarks>
            Reason: The data being fetched is too big to fit into the input message
            	buffer which SQLBase increases dynamically but, the database
            	router has run out of memory on the client workstation computer.
            
            Remedy: If you are using DBROUTER.EXE, you can increase the size of the
            	SQL.INI configuration parameter called HEAP or try using the
            	extended memory version of this program called DBXROUTR.EXE if
            	extended memory is available.  If you are already using
            	DBXROUTR.EXE then you can provide more extended memory.  And

            	UPDATE or INSERT then verify that the column number used with

            	represents the maximum seconds allowed to perform a compile and
            	execute for a command.  After the specified time has elapsed,
            	the command is aborted. The default setting is 0 seconds which
            	disables the command timeout check.
            	Valid timeout values are:
            	1 to 43,200 Seconds before timing out (1 second to 12 hours)
            	0 	  Never timeout.

            Reason: The update or insert value was NULL, but the target column was
            	declared as NOT NULL in the table definition.  Consequently,
            	null values cannot be inserted into that column, and values in

            Remedy: The statement cannot be execute.	Examine the definition of the
            	target table to determine which columns of the table have the
            	NOT NULL attribute, and correct the SQL statement accordingly.
            	DB2 treats "empty" strings and NULL strings as different whereas
            	SQLBase does not distinguish between an "empty" string and a
            	NULL string.  This problem may be occurring because a CHAR or
            	VARCHAR column has been defined as NOT NULL WITH DEFAULT and
            	SQLBase uses a one-character space for the DEFAULT.  For DB2
            	compatibility, you may want to consider NOT using the NOT NULL
            	WITH DEFAULT characteristic for CHAR or VARCHAR columns.

            	violating an existing referential integrity constraint. For more
            	information on how to enhance or customize this SQLBase error
            	message, see the SQLBase SQL Language Reference Manual, Chapter 6:

            	indexes.
            
            Remedy: Create an unique index on the column or columns to be included

            Reason: Attempting to add a foreign key and the addition of this foreign

            	the referential integrity constraints.
            
            Remedy: A foreign key references a primary key in the same table or

            	values in the foreign key column or columns so that their values

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Reason: FOR SQLBASE: The specified database cannot be found.  SQLBase
            	cannot find the file named "x:\dbdir\dbname\dbname.DBS" where
            	x:\dbdir is either the default, c:\SQLBASE, or modified with
            	the DBDIR SQL.INI configuration keyword.	In a multiuser
            	network configuration, this error indicates that your network
            	is working correctly, but the database system was unable to
            	locate the specified database filename.
            	FOR NON-SQLBASE DATABASES: This problem can also occur with a
            	SQLGateway when leaving out the protocol type in the SERVERNAME
            	parameter that the client uses to communicate with the gateway
            	(like SQLNBIOS).	For example,
            	SERVERNAME=SERVER33,SQLQUEUE
            	DBNAME=DB2DBMS, SQLQUEUE, SQLNBIOS
            	will nott allow a remote client process (using SQLNBIOS on the LAN
            	to communicate with the SQLGateway machine) to connect to the
            	SQLGateway machine.
            	For SPX connectivity from DOS or MS Windows to a Unixware
            	SQLBase Server check for the omission of the "serverpath=..."
            	parameter in the SQL.INI file under the client section.
            
            Remedy: Verify the database file exists.	The default drive letter and
            	dbdirname is c:\SQLBASE unless overridden with a DBDIR SQL.INI
            	configuration keyword parameter.	Verify the DBDIR keyword is
            	not missing or pointing to a wrong database directory.  Verify
            	the DBNAME keyword is specified for the named database.  Verify
            	the SERVER keyword is not missing or conflicting with other
            	network server names.  In your CONFIG.SYS file, verify at least
            	40 files set with the FILES=40 parameter.  If the server was
            	being initialized while the connection was tried, retry the
            	connection after the server has initialized.  If all of the
            	above fails, try using a different database name or try
            	connecting to the database in single user mode at the same
            	machine.	If you can connect with a local engine it probably
            	indicates a network configuration error exists.  If you can
            	connect with a new database name it probably indicates a
            	previously named database was never properly initialized.

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Reason: The user tried to connect to a database without recovery turned
            	on; but the database still has distributed transactions
            	pending recovery. If the no recovery connect is allowed,
            	it will not be possible to resolve such transactions.
            
            Remedy: Resolve the pending distributed transactions. Normally this
            	will happen automatically when you connect to the database
            	in the "normal" mode, if the commit-server(s) for the
            	transactions is still accessible and the information is not
            	lost. If this is not true or you don't care about how the
            	transactions are resolved, you can manually resolve the
            	transactions (see the manual), and then connect with recovery

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Reason: A pointer which is part of a view or stored command cannot be
            	relocated.  This relocation happens when a view is referenced in
            	a subsequent command or when a stored command is retrieved.  The
            	object being retrieved (either a view or a stored command) may
            	be bad.  A pointer stored in the view or stored command is no
            	longer valid and therefore cannot be relocated.  Also, the
            	pointer might be good but the data structure used to relocate
            	the pointer may be bad.
            
            Remedy: The problem can be resolved by dropping the view or restoring
            	the stored command.  Run a CHECK DATABASE to verify the
            	integrity of the database.

            00701 VIO OCP Out of cache pages
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Reason: Database cache is page buffers which can hold the most recently
            	referenced database pages. The number of cache pages is
            	specified by the CACHE configuration parameter in the SQL.INI
            	file. Whenever a database page is accessed, SQLBase first
            	locates a cache page for it. Sometimes the database page is
            	already in cache. If the page is not already in the cache,
            	SQLBase locates a free cache page and reads the database page
            	into the cache page and then uses the cache page buffer to
            	perform the desired operation. While SQLBase is performing
            	operations on the cache page it refers to them as "inuse". Once
            	SQLBase is done with the cache page, it is marked as "free".
            	To locate free cache pages, SQLBase searches a LRU (least
            	recently used) chain. If SQLBase goes through the entire LRU chain
            	and all pages are inuse, it waits and then gives this error
            	message. If some user frees up a page while SQLBase is waiting,
            	SQLBase uses that page.
            
            Remedy: There are various alternatives to avoiding this problem. One
            	quick solution is to increase the number of CACHE pages.
            	Another solution is to reduce the number of "inuse" cache pages
            	by reducing the span of the active transactions. That is,
            	COMMIT the transaction more often in the application programs.
            	Also, try eliminating any unnecessary drivers at the database
            	computer such as DOS16M settings, HIMEM.SYS, etc.

            00805 ROW NUD Insert/update of unique constrained columns with duplicate data
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Reason: The target table of an INSERT or UPDATE operation is constrained
            	(by a CREATE UNIQUE INDEX statement) to have unique values in
            	certain columns.	Completion of the requested INSERT or UPDATE
            	would result in duplicate values occurring in the row.  If a
            	view is the object of the INSERT or UPDATE statement, the table
            	that defines the view is constrained.  The update might also be
            	caused by a DELETE operation of a parent row that cascades to a
            	dependent row with a delete rule of SET NULL.
            
            Remedy: Examine the definitions for any UNIQUE INDEX indexes to
            	determine the uniqueness constraints imposed.  For an UPDATE
            	statement, verify that the specified operation is consistent
            	with the uniqueness constraint.  If this does not indicate the
            	error, examine the target table to determine the cause of the
            	problem.	For an INSERT statement, examine the target table to
            	determine which values violate the uniqueness constraint.  If
            	the INSERT statement contains a subquery, match the contents of
            	the table addressed by the subquery and the contents of the
            	target table to determine the cause of the problem.  For a
            	DELETE statement, examine the index key columns in the table
            	that defines the index.  These columns contain a foreign key,
            	which when set NULL on a cascade delete from the target table,
            	causes the duplicate values.

            00807 ROW IIC Index is corrupt
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Reason: The current operation is attempting to use an index that has
            	been found to be corrupt.
            
            Remedy: Try to determine which index is corrupt. The EXPLAIN command
            	may help diagnose which indexes were being used.	Running a
            	CHECK DATABASE may also flush out the corrupt index.  Once you
            	have identified the corrupt index, drop the index, and recreate
            	it. Run CHECK DATABASE to verify the consistency of the
            	database.  And, finally, rerun the operation that was causing
            	the corrupt index problem to occur.

            Reason: A column name is used two (or more) times in an area of a SQL statement

            <remarks>
            Reason: This is a Fatal Error.  But, it may have been caused because the

            	like OS/2 and it used multiple threads that submitted multiple
            	API requests when the API is a single threaded operation.  That
            	is, the API expects a message to be sent and an answer received
            	before another message is sent.  This error may have occurred
            	because the application sent a second message to the database
            	computer without receiving an answer from the first message.
            
            Remedy: Stop all database activity and run a CHECK DATABASE.  If a
            	FAIL.SQL file is found, save it.	If your application has
            	submitted multiple requests to the application without waiting

            <remarks>
            Reason: A backup directory specified during a backup, recovery, or
            	restore has been specified incorrectly.  The backup directory
            	must include a fully-qualified path name and cannot exceed 115 bytes.
            
            Remedy: Specify backup directory with a fully-qualified path name.
            	For example, if the backup directory is in C:\SQLBASE\BACKUP
            	then the specified directory must be either "C:\SQLBASE\BACKUP"
            	or "\SQLBASE\BACKUP".  The directory name of "SQLBASE\BACKUP"
            	or "BACKUP" would not be sufficient.

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Reason: The server has detected a condition where the minimum amount of
            	data to send to a client exceeds the buffer size for that data.
            	The server sends this error code back to the client, but does
            	not send any of the data that caused the overflow.  The router
            	at the client detects the condition and automatically attempts
            	to correct for it by allocating a larger input message buffer.
            	The router will automatically re-request the data be sent again
            	using the new buffer size.  The router and the server will
            	continue to negotiate the buffer size until one of the following
            	occurs:
            	1. The server is successfully able to transmit the data to the
            	client, or
            	2. The server or the client router run out of available memory
            	at their respective machines.
            	This error message should only appear at the server.  It should
            	not be seen at the client.  The server and the client router
            	perform the buffer size negotiation without the client's
            	knowledge or participation.  If the client app sees this error,
            	it should be treated as a fatal error.
            
            Remedy: None.  This message should only appear on the server.
            	It should not be seen by the client application.

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Reason: The database system has detected a user deadlock situation.
            	A deadlock situation is an occurrence such that two or more
            	transactions are in a simultaneous wait state, each one waiting
            	for the other to release a lock before it can proceed.
            	SQLBase detects deadlocks immediately; that is, without waiting
            	the duration of the timeout period.  If SQLBase detects a
            	deadlock, it will break the deadlock by rolling back the
            	transaction that detected the deadlock and return this error
            	message to the detector. The other transaction will continue
            	not even knowing a deadlock situation was detected.
            
            Remedy: Determine what transactions are becoming deadlocked and attempt
            	to make changes so that the deadlock situation does not occur
            	frequently.  A COMMIT as often as possible helps to avoid
            	deadlocks.

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Reason: The database server has exceeded the number of possible locks.
            
            Remedy: Increase the number of database server locks by changing the
            	configuration parameter in the SQL.INI file associated with the
            	database server.	The parameter is LOCKS=nnn.  This parameter
            	sets the maximum number of lock entries that will be allocated.
            	Lock entries are dynamically allocated as they are needed in
            	groups of 100.  If the LOCKS= parameter is not used, locks will
            	be allocated as needed until there is not enough memory left.
            	The only time you need to specify this keyword is when you are
            	trying to protect against a runaway application that is
            	accessing too much data in one transaction.  If you are getting
            	this error, then chances are good that you have a runaway
            	application on your hands.

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Reason: The transaction is waiting for a resource currently locked by
            	another transaction.  The transaction will wait by default 275
            	seconds unless otherwise specified.
            
            Remedy: Determine what transaction is locking the resources and attempt
            	to make changes so that the wait situation does not occur
            	frequently.  A COMMIT as often as possible helps to avoid
            	these timeout conditions.  To reduce the time wait period, you
            	can use the set timeout function call (sqltio) or in SQLTalk you
            	can SET TIMEOUT n, where n is the number of seconds.  The number
            	of seconds can range from 1 to 1800 seconds (30 minutes).

            <remarks>
            Reason: The first connection by any transaction acquires a shared
            	database lock, which is released upon the last disconnect
            	for the transaction.  Your attempt to exclusively lock the

            	you are waiting for a resource currently locked (in shared
            	mode) by another transaction. Your LOCK DATABASE request
            	will succeed when all shared database locks by other
            	transactions have been released.
            
            Remedy: Determine what other transactions are connected to the

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Reason: The user attempted to access a database or server that was
            	not local to the user.  The database or server was located
            	remotely in the network, but was configured for local access
            	only. Servers that are configured for local access only can
            	support connections from applications running on the same
            	machine as the server, but cannot accept connections from
            	remote users.
            
            Remedy: Check to see if the database name (or server name, in the
            	case of a server connection) is spelled correctly. Correct
            	any misspellings in the database or server name and try
            	the connection again. If the name is spelled correctly, the
            	problem may be in database name duplication. Try using
            	NETPREFIX in the SQL.INI file to provide better database
            	name isolation. NETPREFIX may need to go into the SQL.INI
            	file for the server issuing this error message, as well as
            	into the SQL.INI file of the application receiving this

            Remedy: Correct the application program. The sequence of events should
            	be calling sqlini() first followed by any and all other sql
            	functions and finally terminating with a sqldon function call.

            <remarks>
            Reason: Whenever a Windows program calls the SQLBase API for the first
            	time, it gets allocated a slot where a pointer to its data is
            	kept.  Before the Microsoft Windows application terminates, it is
            	suppose to call sqldon() to free the slot.  The current
            	Microsoft Windows program is probably failing to call sqldon().
            
            Remedy: Call sqldon() before exiting the Microsoft Windows application
            	program.

            <remarks>
            Reason: This error is returned to the client computer when the cursor is
            	tied to a network session that no longer exists.	Once you get
            	this error on a cursor, subsequent tries will also yield the
            	same error.  Other cursors sharing the same network session will
            	get this error also.  If applications are exiting without
            	disconnecting all their cursors, the database server can confuse
            	a new instance of an application with an old one.  If the new
            	and old instance have the same MS Windows task ID, the database
            	server might tell the new instance to use a network session
            	created by the old instance.
            
            Remedy: Check if some other error occurred before receiving this error.
            	Other errors that may have gone undetected may have caused this
            	error.  Also check that all cursors are disconnected before
            	terminating each run of an application.  This can be checked by
            	seeing if there are any sessions left on the database server
            	screen after running and exiting each application.  Check
            	whether the applications ever terminate in ways where sessions
            	are not disconnected.

            <remarks>
            Reason: This is a Fatal Error.
            
            Remedy: Stop all database operations and run a CHECK DATABASE operation.
            	If a FAIL.SQL file is available, then save it.  Attempt to
            	reproduce the problem via a SQL script, scenario, or using the
            	NETLOG utility (see the DBA Guide for how to produce a NETLOG).

            03912 LOG ETS Exceed transaction span limit
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Reason: The transaction has exceeded the transaction span limit and
            	therefore has been rolled back by the system.
            
            Remedy: Long running transactions can pin down disk log files that could
            	otherwise be deleted.  The transaction span limit prevents logs
            	from being pinned down by long running active transactions.  To
            	fix this problem, either modify the transactions so that they
            	are not long running, that is, COMMIT more frequently, or
            	increase or eliminate the transaction span limit.

            <remarks>
            Reason: No LISTEN command is outstanding on the remote computer.	This
            	problem may stem from using the Novell NETBios and Microsoft
            	Windows.	You may be able to connect to SQLBase from Microsoft
            	Windows in standard mode but not when in enhanced mode.
            
            Remedy: Wait until a LISTEN is issued on the remote computer.  Many
            	variables may be involved including the network card (type and
            	brand), IRQ, client workstation computer speed, database server
            	computer speed and which versions of network drivers.  If you
            	slow down the database server computer, you can verify that this
            	is the problem.  Changing network cards and/or IRQ's might
            	solve the problem.  The best solution for Novell customers is to
            	get Novell's NETBios 3.01 rev F or later and the latest versions
            	of IPX and NET3 (at least rev d).  Moving to MS Windows 3.0A or

            	next FAT (File Allocation Table) entry from the FAT table and it
            	cannot find the disk buffer.  DIRECTIO works with 12-bit and

            	the sector, it extracts the FAT entry.
            
            Remedy: Determine why the disk buffer cannot be retrieved.  For more
            	detailed information on FAT tables, see the DOS technical

            <remarks>
            Reason: The database system has determined DIRECTIO cannot be used on
            	the database server computer.  More generally, this means that
            	SQLBase has examined the specified disk drive, and SQLBase
            	cannot determine what the file structure looks like.  This could
            	potentially happen by having a non-standard disk extender
            	installed such as SPEEDSTORE.  Also, the file structure
            	may be corrupted and can be fixed by running CHKDSK.
            
            Remedy: Determine why the database server computer cannot use DIRECTIO.
            	Set the configuration DIRECTIO off, that is, DIRECTIO=0.

            Remedy: Determine and correct the cause of the create failure.  Run a

            Remedy: Determine and correct the cause of the disk write failure.  Most
            	commonly, it may be because you have run out of available disk
            	space.  If sufficient disk space is available, then run a check
            	disk utility (CHKDSK) for the current operating system to verify
            	the status of the disk.

            	(3) For a SEND or (4) for a RECEIVE, the timeout period specified

            	timeout period has expired for an outstanding SEND to complete.
            
            Remedy: (1) For a CALL, try again later. (2) For an ADAPTER STATUS, make
            	sure you are using a correct name. (3) For a SEND, the session
            	has been terminated abnormally.  Establish another session and

            Reason: This error is currently undocumented.
            
            Remedy: If you are using a 3Com LAN Manager, there is a file called
            	\3OPEN\OS2WRKSTA\LANMAN\LANMAN.INI (fully qualified) that has a
            	section in it like: [workstation]
            	maxcmds=nn
            	maxthreads=nn
            	Make maxcmds=64 and maxthreads=32 and it may solve your problem.
            	Another file that possibly is important is the file:
            	\3OPEN\OS2WRKSTA\LANMAN\DRIVERS\ADAPTER\LDR.CFG (fully
            	qualified) that has a line like: "program=
            	c:\3open\os2wrksta\lanman\drivers\adapter\nba.exe /s32 /n32"
            	where the /s is important because it tells the adapter card the
            	number of session and the /n tells the adapter card the number
            	of commands.

            Reason: No COMDLL specification has been found in SQL.INI. At least one

            	For example, COMDLL=SQLWS32 is used for NT and Windows 98 and
            	COMDLL=SQLWSOCK is used for Windows 3.x to identify WinSock as
            	the communication protocol to be used.  The location of these
            	configuration parameters is dependent on the environment and

            	in the [xxxxx.DLL] section of the SQL.INI file.
            
            Remedy: Verify the spelling of the protocol name on the DBNAME or

            Reason: Any table that is involved in a delete operation is

            	table, any table in the cycle must not be delete-connected to

            	if necessary to ensure that you are not recursing too deeply.
            	If you are executing a DML command that has a trigger, examine

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Reason: Attempting to start an audit (without the APPEND clause) and
            	the specified file name already exists. Or the current audit
            	file has reached its maximum SIZE and when attempting to roll
            	over to the next audit file that file was found to already
            	exist, and the OVERWRITE clause was not specified.
            
            Remedy: Correct the problem by specifying an audit name that does not
            	already exist as a file. Or append to an existing audit file
            	using the APPEND option. Or restart the AUDIT with the
            	OVERWRITE clause. Or delete the target file.

            	specified size and needs more disk space/file segments to
            	complete the unload operation.
            
            Remedy: Edit the unload control file to increase the number of segments
            	or the size of the file segments to accommodate all the unload
            	data. See the manual for segmented unload and control file

            <remarks>
            If cursor context preservation is On (1), SQLBase prevents a COMMIT from destroying an active result set, thereby enabling an application to maintain its position after a COMMIT, INSERT, or UPDATE.<para/>
            Locks are kept on pages required to maintain the fetch position. Be aware that this can block other applications trying to access the same data. Also, locks can prevent other applications from doing DDL operations.<para/>
            By default, cursor context preservation is Off (0). A COMMIT destroys a cursor’s result set or compiled command.<para/>
            SQLBase does not preserve cursor context after an isolation level change or a system-initiated ROLLBACK, such as a deadlock, timeout, etc. SQLBase does preserve cursor context after a user-initiated ROLLBACK if both of the following are true:<para/>
            1) The application is in Release Locks (RL) isolation level.<para/>

            <remarks>
            This function changes the maximum size (in bytes) of the input message buffer. The input message buffer is allocated on both the client computer and on the database server. The database server builds an input message in this buffer on the database server computer and sends it across the network to a buffer of the same size on the client. It is called an input message buffer because it is input from the client's point of view.<para/>
            There is one input message buffer per connected cursor on the client computer. The server maintains an input message buffer that is the size of the largest input message buffer on the client computer.<para/>
            The input message buffer can receive a return code indicating that the specified operation was successful, the data that is being fetched, and other information. While fetching data from the database, SQLBase compacts as many rows as possible into one input message buffer.<para/>
            Each sqlfet call reads the next row from the input message buffer until they are exhausted. At this instant, SQLBase transparently fetches the next input buffer of rows depending on the isolation level.<para/>
            A large input message buffer can help performance while fetching data from the database because it reduces the number of network messages. Note that a large input message buffer can affect system throughput because of concurrency. Any row currently in the input message buffer can have a shared lock on it (depending on the isolation level) preventing other users from changing that row. Therefore, a large input message buffer can cause more shared locks to remain than are necessary.<para/>
            See the explanation of sqlsil for more information about how each isolation level uses the input message buffer.<para/>
            SQLBase automatically maintains an input message buffer large enough to hold at least one row of data. Despite the specified input message size, SQLBase dynamically allocates more space if necessary.<para/>
            A large input message buffer helps performance when reading LONG VARCHAR columns.<para/>
            This function can also improve overall system performance by decreasing the size of the input message buffer when an application does not need to fetch data.<para/>

            <remarks>The output message buffer is allocated on both the client computer and on the database server. The client builds an output message in this buffer and sends it to a buffer of the same size on the database server. It is called an output message buffer because it is output from the client's point of view.<para/>
            The most important messages sent from the client to the database server are SQL commands to compile or a row of data to insert.<para/>
            A large output message buffer does not necessarily increase performance because it only needs to be large enough to hold the largest SQL command to compile, or large enough to hold the largest row of data to insert. A large output message buffer can allocate space unnecessarily on the both the client and the server. Rows are always inserted and sent one row at a time (except in bulk execute mode). A larger output message buffer does not reduce network traffic unless bulk execute is on.<para/>
            SQLBase automatically maintains an output message buffer large enough to hold any SQL command or a row to insert of any length (given available memory). Despite the specified output message buffer size, SQLBase dynamically allocates more space for the output message buffer if needed.<para/>
            A large output message buffer can help performance when writing LONG VARCHAR columns.<para/>

            <remarks>
            This function aborts a database server process. You cannot abort a process that the server is currently processing. For example, if a client sends a SELECT statement to a server, the process cannot be aborted until the server begins returning rows.
            When a database process is aborted, it ends its network sessions and does a rollback of its transactions.
